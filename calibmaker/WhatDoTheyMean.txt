PZ = Ole Zero Cancellator
SE = Singel Ended (SMA output)

Sum HG = Summerized channel output with High gain
Sum LG = Summerized channel output with low gain
(These are two physicly different outputs!)

#NAME# - PROPERTIES FROM MANUAL - WHAT IT PHYSICLY DOES
---
LOWATLAD_PZ - Switch PZ attenuation to low (1 = low, 0= high) - set to 1 and you get a lower amplitude
